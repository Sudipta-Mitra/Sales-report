# Sales-report

# Objective :
This Power BI Sales Dashboard project was developed to analyze company sales performance from January 2018 to December 2021. The dashboard integrates key data points such as Sales by City, Product Sub-Categories (e.g., Phones, Machines, etc.), and Customer Segments, providing a detailed and interactive visual representation of sales trends over four years.

# Key features include:

- Year-over-Year Sales Comparison from 2018 to 2021

- State-wise Interactive Map to visualize geographical sales distribution

- Performance Breakdown by Product Sub-Category and Segment

- Profit Analysis to understand revenue contributions across categories and regions

The dashboard uses interactive visuals, filters, and slicers to enable dynamic exploration of sales data, allowing decision-makers to gain valuable insights into business performance.

# Problem Statement and Solution:
Companies often face challenges in identifying which regions, products, or customer segments are driving sales due to fragmented or static data reporting. This project addresses the issue by centralizing sales data into a dynamic, visually-rich Power BI dashboard.

By implementing this solution, the company can:

- Identify high-performing cities and regions for focused efforts

- Track sub-category and segment-wise performance to support strategic planning

- Analyze profit distribution to optimize resource allocation

- Compare sales trends across years for better forecasting and growth planning

This leads to data-driven decision-making, improved performance tracking, and strategic clarity across business operations.
